forest = Question.create(q1: 'Who are you walking with?', q2: 'What kind of animal is it?',q3: 'What does the animal do?',q4: 'How big is it? Is it fenced in or no?',q5: "Describe what's on the table.",q6: 'What is the cup made out of? What do you do with the cup?', q7: 'What kind of body of water is it? A lake? River? Pond?',q8: 'How wet do you get?',q9: 'Ready for some answers?',a1: 'The person you were walking with is the most important person in your life.',a2: 'The size of the animal you come across is a representation of the size of your problems.',a3: 'If your action was more severe, it means you tend to be more aggressive. If it was peaceful, then more passive.',a4: 'The size of your home is representative of the size of your ambition.',a5: 'If there was no fence around the home, it means you tend to be more open.',a6: "If what you saw on the table wasn't food, people, or flowers, it indicates some unhappiness.",a7: 'How durable the cup you found was is representative of how strong your relationship is with the person in the first part of the story. What you do with it is representative of your attitude toward them.',a8: 'The size of the body of water is related to the size of your sexual drive.',a9: "If you became very wet, it indicates that sex is important to you. If not very wet, it may mean it's less important.")
love = Question.create(q1: "You are walking to your boy/girlfriend's house. There are two roads to get there. One is a straight path to take you there quickly, but is very plain and boring. The other is significantly longer but is full of wonderful sights and interesting things. Which one do you take to get your significant other's house, short or long?",q2: "On the way you see 2 rose bushes. One is full of red roses, the other full of white. You decide to pick 20 roses for your boy/girlfriend, of any color combination. What number of white and red do you pick? (you can pick all of one or any combo of the two).",q3: "You finally get to their house. A family member answers the door. You can have them get your boy/girlfriend or go get them yourself. Which do you do?",q4: "You go up to you boy/girlfriend's room, but nobody is there. You decide to leave the roses. Do you leave them by the windowsill or on the bed?",q5: "Later, it's time for bed. You and your boy/girlfriend go to sleep in separate rooms. In the morning when its time to wake up you go in their room and check on them. When you arrive, are they awake or asleep?",q6: "Now it's time to go back home. Do you take the short, plain road or the longer, more interesting road?", a1: "The road represents your attitude towards falling in love. If you take the short road, you fall in love quickly and easily. If you take the long road, you take your time and do not fall in love as easily.",a2: "The number of red roses represents how much you give in a relationship, while the number of white represents what you expect in return. For example, if you chose 18 red and 2 white, you give 90% and expect 10% in return.",a3: "This question represents your attitude towards handling relationship problems. If you asked the family member to get you significant other, then you like to avoid problems and hope that they will solve themselves. If you went to get them yourself, then you are a more direct person and like to work out problems immediately.",a4: "The placement of roses determines how much you like to see your boy/girlfriend. Placing them on the bed means you like to see them a lot, while placing them on the windowsill means that you are alright with not seeing them as much.",a5: "This is representative of your attitude towards their personality. If you find them asleep, you love your boy/girlfriend the way they are. If you find them awake, you expect them to change for you.",a6: "The road to home tells how long you stay in love with someone. If you chose the short road, you fall out of love easily. If you chose the longer one, you will tend to stay in love for a long time.")
castle = Question.create(q1: "You are in front of the door of the castle. How exactly do you imagine it?",q2: "You pass the door of the castle and realize that there is no soul. It is desert. What is the first thing you see?",q3: "You look around and find a staircase. You decide to climb the stairs. What does the staircase look like?",q4: "After you climb the stairs, you reach a small room in which there is only one window. How big is it?",q5: "You look out the window. What do you see?",q6: "You go down the stairs and you’re back in the area where you were when you first entered the castle. You go ahead and find a door at the rear of the building. You open it and go out in a yard. What exactly does it look like?",a1: "The door represents your attitude to new experiences. If you imagined a simple, everyday door, you probably are not afraid of any new challenge and will test your luck in new things and situations without a second thought. If you have chosen the hidden door, you probably do not know what you need to do in the future and your life in it, and it looks blurry and undefined. Of course, if you have chosen a big, scary door, then you probably are afraid of the unknown and find it difficult to get out of your comfort zone and try new experiences.",a2: "The space inside the castle is the idea that you believe others to have of you. If for example you saw a library, you probably think that you are the person who supports others and helps them find answers to their problems. The large fireplace gives a feeling of warmth and passion that you think you cause in people. A fancy ballroom suggests that you feel that you can dazzle people around you and that you have a lot to give. If you ended up in a long corridor with closed doors, you feel that you are difficult to understand and others will have to try much to ‘penetrate’ more within you.",a3: "The stairway shows the image that you have of life. The sharp and massive staircase shows a person who sees life as suffering, with many difficulties. Unlike the beautiful spiral staircase which shows how romantic a person is.",a4: "The window is the way you feel right now. A small window means that you feel depressed and trapped in your life. It may feel like there’s no way out of what you are experiencing in this period. A normal window shows a person with realistic demands and expectations of life at this stage. You realize that there are limitations, but the future is here and it looks clear for you. Conversely, if the window is gigantic, you probably feel invincible, free and able to achieve what you want.",a5: "The view from the window is the overview of your whole life! A stormy sea shows a hectic and erratic life, while a snowy forest is associated with a person who lived isolated and detached from the crowds. The green valley shows that your life is calm and steady, without much stress and anxiety. Finally, the vibrant city is related to someone who generally lives full life socializing with lots of people.",a6: "The image of the courtyard is the image that you have in mind of your future! So if your garden is neat and shiny, then you feel that your future will be heavenly. On the other, a picture of a promising but neglected garden shows an optimistic person, who is worried if he can find the energy to take control of his life and make his future more beautiful. Those who chose the grassy, damaged garden are pessimistic that do not have a nice picture of the future.")
